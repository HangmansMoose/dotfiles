;; management seamless without needing external plugins.

;; This configuration customizes `dired' to enhance its usability. The settings
;; below specify how file listings are displayed, the target for file operations,
;; and associations for opening various file types with their respective applications.
;; For example, image files will open with `feh', while audio and video files
;; will utilize `mpv'.

;;; LSP
;; Emacs comes with an integrated LSP client called `eglot', which offers basic LSP functionality.
;; However, `eglot' has limitations, such as not supporting multiple language servers
;; simultaneously within the same buffer (e.g., handling both TypeScript, Tailwind and ESLint
;; LSPs together in a React project). For this reason, the more mature and capable
;; `lsp-mode' is included as a third-party package, providing advanced IDE-like features
;; and better support for multiple language servers and configurations.
;;
;; NOTE: To install or reinstall an LSP server, use `M-x install-server RET`.
;;       As with other editors, LSP configurations can become complex. You may need to
;;       install or reinstall the server for your project due to version management quirks
;;       (e.g., asdf or nvm) or other issues.
